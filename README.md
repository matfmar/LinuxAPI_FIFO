# LinuxAPI_FIFO
Project includes an app which communicates with its second instance process via named pipe (FIFO). Includes extensive Linux API work-up.

## About the project
The user needs to compile and run two instances of this application (as two processes). The apps will then communicate via IPC who is the client and who is the server. Then, sending data between them via named pipe (FIFO) is enabled.
